  # Put your test command here.
  # If you don't need to build C extensions on 64-bit Python 3.3 or 3.4,
  # you can remove "build.cmd" from the front of the command, as it's
  # only needed to support those cases.
  # Note that you must use the environment variable %PYTHON% to refer to
  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
  # to put the Python version you want to use on PATH.
  #- "build.cmd %PYTHON%\\python.exe setup.py test"

  # Run some tests
  - mkdir tmp
  - cd tmp
  - python ../tests/test_basic.py
  - cd ..


after_test:
  # This step builds your wheels.
  # Again, you only need build.cmd if you're building C extensions for
  # 64-bit Python 3.3/3.4. And you need to use %PYTHON% to get the correct
  # interpreter
  #- "build.cmd %PYTHON%\\python.exe setup.py bdist_wheel"
  - dir dist

#artifacts:
#  # bdist_wheel puts your built wheel in the dist directory
#  - path: dist\*

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
